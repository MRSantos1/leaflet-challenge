Leaflet Visualization Challenge
The following repo utilizes mapbox layers, and earthquake data extracted from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) to present a map showing earhtqukes that have occured in the United States. The map is interactive, meaning that the user has the ability to change the layer types of the map. The included layers are Satelite (to view the Earth in real time), Grayscale (to contrast the epicenter's data points), and Outdoors (for a topographical view of where the quakes occured).

In addition to the map layer interactivity, mouse-over functionality has been included. The user has the ability to click on a quake occurence, and see when the quake struck, its magnitude, and what type of event occured.

Lastly, since this map is a .js application, please execute the map by using, 'python -m http.server' and viewing it in an incognito window to prevent any rendering conflicts.
